## Overview

**Advanced Prompting: Chain of Thought and ReAct** is a comprehensive Python repository designed to explore and implement advanced prompting strategies for Large Language Models (LLMs). Leveraging **Chain of Thought** and **ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)** paradigms, this project integrates with external tools like Wikipedia and utilizes platforms such as Google Cloud Vertex AI and Langchain to enhance the reasoning and action capabilities of LLMs.

## Features

- **Chain of Thought Prompting**: Enhances LLM reasoning by providing step-by-step exemplars.
- **ReAct Prompting**: Combines reasoning with actions to interact with external tools.
- **Langchain Integration**: Utilizes Langchain for building ReAct agents with built-in tool integrations.
- **Self-Consistency**: Implements techniques to improve the reliability and consistency of LLM responses.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Includes unit tests for all modules using Python's `unittest` framework with mocked external dependencies.
- **Modular Design**: Organized into modular Python classes for scalability and maintainability.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**: Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Google Cloud Account**: Required for accessing Vertex AI.
- **Google Cloud SDK**: Install and initialize the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).
